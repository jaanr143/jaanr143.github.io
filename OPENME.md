Taylor Swift is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released by Big Machine Records on October 24, 2006, in the United States and Canada, and March 18, 2008, internationally. Swift had signed with Sony/ATV Tree publishing house in 2004, at age 14, to pursue a career as a country musician. Her contract with Big Machine in 2005 enabled her to work on the album during her first high school year.

1. Teardrops on my guitar -  the lyrics is inspired by her unrequited love for a high school classmate. It's my top 1 because I love the lyrics and relate to it. 
2. Our song -  the lyrics is about a young couple using the regular events in their lives to create their own song. I like the beat, creativity, and it's popular on tiktok
3. Tim Mcgraw - the lyrics narrate a summer romance that comes to a sudden end. In the storyline, the narrator pleads with her ex-boyfriend to reminisce about her every time he hears her favorite song by country musician Tim McGraw, the song's namesake.

##  FEARLESS (2008)

1. You Belong With Me-  it is inspired by a phone call between a male friend of hers and his girlfriend that she overheard, the lyrics is about an insecure protagonist's unrequited love for an out-of-reach interest. Once again relatable and it was my favorite song when I was in elementary. 
2. The Way I Loved You - the lyrics is about being in love with a bad guy when you're going out with a nice guy. It is very popular and relatable to wattpad sotries that I read and the song is fun to sing 
3. Love story -  Swift wrote the song using William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet as a reference point. The lyrics narrate a troubled romance between two characters that ends with a marriage proposal, contrary to Shakespeare's tragic conclusion. 

##  SPEAK NOW(2010)

1. Enchanted - the song is about infatuation with someone after meeting them for the first time, and worrying about whether the initial feeling will be reciprocated. 
2. Back to December - The lyrics are about a remorseful plea for forgiveness from a former lover. I also don't relater to this much but I love the harmony, melody, and lyrics. 
3. Speak Now -  the track is about a protagonist interrupting a wedding in an attempt to win her ex-lover back. I don't relate to it much but I love the bridge on the chorus. 

##  RED(2012)

1. All too well - the song is about a couple with an age gap who tried to work it out despite the age gap but failed miserably. This is my favorite song of all her songs except I prefer the 10 minute version. 
2. Red - it is about a tumultuous relationship, the refrain likens the conflicting emotions to a spectrum of colors, including the color red which symbolizes the ensuing intense feelings. I love the bridge when she sings the chorus but I don't relate to it much. 
3. 22 - the lyrics celebrate being 22 years old while acknowledging the heartache that the narrator experienced in the past. "22" became a cultural phenomenon resulting in the prominence of 22nd birthdays. I love the instrumentals but I dont relate to it. 

##  1989(2014)

1. Style - the song is about an unhealthy relationship from which a couple could not escape, because they are never "out of style". I love this song besides the fact that I'm also a fan of Harry Styles, the beat is perfect and makes me dance. 
2. Blank Space - the song is about a satirical self-referential nod to her reputation as a flirtatious woman with a series of romantic attachments, which blemished her once-wholesome girl next door image. I love the way that it's almost identical to a rap, and is the first taylor swift song that I heard. 
3. Shake it off -  it is about Swift's indifference to her detractors and their negative view of her image. I love the rap-like part near the chorus, it's very popular on tiktok and the music is catchy.
