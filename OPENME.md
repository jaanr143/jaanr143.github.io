Taylor Swift is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released by Big Machine Records on October 24, 2006, in the United States and Canada, and March 18, 2008, internationally. Swift had signed with Sony/ATV Tree publishing house in 2004, at age 14, to pursue a career as a country musician. Her contract with Big Machine in 2005 enabled her to work on the album during her first high school year.

1. Teardrops on my guitar -  the lyrics is inspired by her unrequited love for a high school classmate. It's my top 1 because I love the lyrics and relate to it. 
2. Our song -  the lyrics is about a young couple using the regular events in their lives to create their own song. I like the beat, creativity, and it's popular on tiktok
3. Tim Mcgraw - the lyrics narrate a summer romance that comes to a sudden end. In the storyline, the narrator pleads with her ex-boyfriend to reminisce about her every time he hears her favorite song by country musician Tim McGraw, the song's namesake.

##  FEARLESS (2008)

1. You Belong With Me-  it is inspired by a phone call between a male friend of hers and his girlfriend that she overheard, the lyrics is about an insecure protagonist's unrequited love for an out-of-reach interest. Once again relatable and it was my favorite song when I was in elementary. 
2. The Way I Loved You - the lyrics is about being in love with a bad guy when you're going out with a nice guy. It is very popular and relatable to wattpad sotries that I read and the song is fun to sing 
3. Love story -  Swift wrote the song using William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet as a reference point. The lyrics narrate a troubled romance between two characters that ends with a marriage proposal, contrary to Shakespeare's tragic conclusion. 

##  SPEAK NOW(2010)
<img src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118234261/203672498-bcbf5527-97ab-42a4-ad9d-0abc9bb09aca.png width =200>

1. Enchanted - the song is about infatuation with someone after meeting them for the first time, and worrying about whether the initial feeling will be reciprocated. 
2. Back to December - The lyrics are about a remorseful plea for forgiveness from a former lover. I also don't relater to this much but I love the harmony, melody, and lyrics. 
3. Speak Now -  the track is about a protagonist interrupting a wedding in an attempt to win her ex-lover back. I don't relate to it much but I love the bridge on the chorus. 

##  RED(2012)
<img src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118234261/204115707-e71b851d-4cde-4ff9-a7d2-5014b1e3eb1a.png width =200>

1. All too well - the song is about a couple with an age gap who tried to work it out despite the age gap but failed miserably. This is my favorite song of all her songs except I prefer the 10 minute version. 
2. Red - it is about a tumultuous relationship, the refrain likens the conflicting emotions to a spectrum of colors, including the color red which symbolizes the ensuing intense feelings. I love the bridge when she sings the chorus but I don't relate to it much. 
3. 22 - the lyrics celebrate being 22 years old while acknowledging the heartache that the narrator experienced in the past. "22" became a cultural phenomenon resulting in the prominence of 22nd birthdays. I love the instrumentals but I dont relate to it. 

##  1989(2014)
<img src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118234261/204115975-1630dfe8-633c-4f7b-b491-e89fba644dec.png width =200>

1. Style - the song is about an unhealthy relationship from which a couple could not escape, because they are never "out of style". I love this song besides the fact that I'm also a fan of Harry Styles, the beat is perfect and makes me dance. 
2. Blank Space - the song is about a satirical self-referential nod to her reputation as a flirtatious woman with a series of romantic attachments, which blemished her once-wholesome girl next door image. I love the way that it's almost identical to a rap, and is the first taylor swift song that I heard. 
3. Shake it off -  it is about Swift's indifference to her detractors and their negative view of her image. I love the rap-like part near the chorus, it's very popular on tiktok and the music is catchy. 

##  Reputation(2017)
<img src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118234261/204116092-6600f283-f6f4-4805-adc8-797d45e4f846.png width =200>

1. Don't Blame Me - the lyirics is about  Swift's unapologetic attitude reflecting her reputation as a songwriter who mostly wrote about love and past relationships. To me, the lyrics mean doing anything even if it's crazy for the person you love. I love this song because I believe that when you truly love someone, you would do even crazy things fopr them. 
2. Getaway Car - the song describes Swift's efforts to exit a relationship using romance with someone else, knowing the new relationship will also end briefly because its purpose was only to "get away" from the first one. The music of this song is very enchanting along with the harmony of the lyrics. 
3. Gorgeous -  the lyrics describes Swift's feelings for a newfound love interest. I like this because I relate to it very much. ;>

##  Lover(2019)
<img src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118234261/204116238-c541ba11-2e62-48ed-9aec-4d419931c38d.png width =200>

1. Lover -  it is about an intimate and committed relationship. The song makes me feel so giddy everytime I hear it. I imagine dancing with someone at prom to this song. 
2. Daylight - it is about leaving a time of darkness and embracing forgiveness for yourself and others. It’s about learning to trust and love in a safe relationship and both people finding healing alongside each other. I love this song because it made me realize that we can be healed and forgiven. It shows us that even after a “20-year dark night” or more, we can still step into the daylight and learn to explore the beauty and depth of love. 
3. London Boy -  it is about an infatuation with a love interest from London, inspired by Swift's experiences in the city. I have a love interest but not in London so I kind of relate HAHAHAHA.

##  Folklore(2020)
<img src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118234261/204122653-9b4e7352-b168-4d57-8893-17e6a88e4d6d.png width =200>

1. Cardigan -  it is about a comforting romance lost in memories, from the perspective of a female narrator named Betty, one of the several fictitious characters narrated in Folklore. I love the pain in the lyrics. 
2. Exile - it is about two estranged lovers having an unspoken dialogue. This song is also very painful and I love it like that.
3. The 1 - the song describes the narrator's newborn positive approach to life and past romance, in a sad but humorous tone, using numerous one-liners. I love the harmony especially in the chorus. 

##  Evermore(2020)
<img src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118234261/204123735-1b9d2997-ba28-4d76-bcca-32b9142691f4.png width =200>

1. Champagne problems - it is written from the perspective of a troubled girlfriend who turns down her lover's earnest marriage proposal due to her own mental health struggles. The song depicts the narrator taking responsibility for the breakup and mourning the faded relationship. I like the song but I don't relate. 
2. Evermore - Taylor tackles topics of mental health when she felt like the whole world was against her. However, she finds hope that the pain she endured during these times wouldn’t last forever. I'm not that familiar with evermore but I've heard it before.
3. Closure - closure is about the anthology of tales about love, marriage, infidelity, and grief, exploring the complexities of human emotion. Not familiar with the song much but I love the title. 

##  Midnights(2022)

1. Labyrinth - it is about falling in love again after a heartbreak. She overcomes the 3 stages of falling in love, Realization, denial, and acceptance. My top 1 because I relate to this one very much. 
2. Mastermind - the lyrics is about a protagonist confessing to her lover that she in the past had carefully initiated a plan to make him love her. I relte to this because in the past, I used to mastermind to make my crush sit close to me and etc. Although now I prefer things to go naturally and not my plan. I'm starting to let loose and be who I am instead of pretending to be someone I'm not. 
3. Midnight rain -  it is about leaving behind the comfort of a healthy relationship to avoid settling. I like how the voice changed at the first part and the chorus, when I first heard it it made me question whether or not I'm still listening to Taylor Swift. 

Those are all my ratings, reasons, and comments about Taylor Swift's songs and Albums. Each one of her song is the best we just have different favorites and opinions. Again the comments and opinions I stated are not facts and just my opinion so don't take it seriously and literally. We all have different opinions and we should learn to respect each other's comments. As long as we all love and support Taylor that's the most important thing. I hope you enjoyed reading this very long site and it inspires you to make your own and listen to Taylor Swift!
